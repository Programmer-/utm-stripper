utm-stripper


This is a proactive extension that cleans URLs before the request even leaves your computer.

To make it instantaneous, we use the declarativeNetRequest API. 
This is the same engine high-performance ad-blockers use. It happens at the network level, so the UTMs never even reach the website's server.
